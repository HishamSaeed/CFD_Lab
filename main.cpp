/**
 * The main operation reads the configuration file, initializes the scenario and
 * contains the main loop. So here are the individual steps of the algorithm:
 *
 * - read the program configuration file using read_parameters()
 * - set up the matrices (arrays) needed. Use the predefined matrix<typename>
 * type and give initial values in the constructor.
 * - perform the main loop
 * - at the end: destroy any memory allocated and print some useful statistics
 *
 * The layout of the grid is decribed by the first figure below, the enumeration
 * of the whole grid is given by the second figure. All the unknowns corresond
 * to a two-dimensional degree of freedom layout, so they are not stored in
 * arrays, but in a matrix.

 *
 * Within the main loop, the following steps are required (for some of the
 * operations, a definition is defined already within uvp.h):
 *
 * - calculate_dt() Determine the maximal time step size.
 * - boundaryvalues() Set the boundary values for the next time step.
 * - calculate_fg() Determine the values of F and G (diffusion and confection).
 *   This is the right hand side of the pressure equation and used later on for
 *   the time step transition.
 * - calculate_rs()
 * - Iterate the pressure poisson equation until the residual becomes smaller
 *   than eps or the maximal number of iterations is performed. Within the
 *   iteration loop the operation sor() is used.
 * - calculate_uv() Calculate the velocity at the next time step.
